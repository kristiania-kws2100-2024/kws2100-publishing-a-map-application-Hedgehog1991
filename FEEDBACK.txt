This is a very impressive map application. 
You have finished all of the requierments, and also added several other maps such as stadia, polar and OSM.
Also there is a very cool drawing function that lets the user choose between different shaps and lets the user add them to the map.
The user can also remove these shapes afterwards. There are also two layers to choose between. 
I also like the good details in both layers and especially the details from pressing the shelters.
The search function to find shelters is also a cool feature.

Other than that the code is is clean and well written. The only constructive critisism is that the code could have more comments.
So that it is easier to understand what the different parts of the code does.
Other than that, this is a very impressive map application.
